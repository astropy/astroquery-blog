Astroquery has a DOI
====================

A `DOI`_ (or "Digital Object Identifier) is a URL-like pointer to a particular
permanent object.  Astroquery v0.1, `released this past week`_, now has a DOI
pointing to the v0.1 tarball hosted on pypi.  At this point, the authors include
anyone who has contributed a module.

`Figshare`_ is the service that is now hosting a clone of the source code and
providing the DOI (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.805208).

Figshare will generate a new DOI for each new version released, e.g. if we add
a new author, release a bugfix tarball, etc.  This flexibility makes it
preferable to single-version publications like papers and fora.  These issues
are `actively`_ `discussed`_, so feedback is welcome.
