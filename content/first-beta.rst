`Astroquery`_ has been released in beta as of September 15th, 2013.

Astroquery's first beta release coincided with the .Astronomy 5 conference, at
which a large group of early adopters have tested and contributed to the code
base.  Within 2 days of the release, we added a new module (GAMA_) and added a
`new tool`_ to SIMBAD to enable `criteria queries`_.

Astroquery development will continue rapidly.  We have the twitters
(`@astroquerypy`_) and an e-mail address (`astropy.astroquery@gmail.com`), 
so we welcome feedback and suggestions.
