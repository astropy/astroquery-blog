`Astroquery`_ has been released in beta as of September 15th, 2013.

Astroquery's first beta release coincided with the .Astronomy 5 conference, at
which a large group of early adopters have tested and contributed to the code
base.  Within 2 days of the release, we added a new module (GAMA_, by
`@j_t_allen`_) and added a `new tool`_ to SIMBAD to enable `criteria queries`_;
`@cosmicpudding`_ showed it in action `here`_.

Astroquery development will continue rapidly.  We have the twitters
(`@astroquerypy`_) and an e-mail address (`astropy.astroquery@gmail.com`_).  We
welcome feedback, including suggestions and contributed code.
