Astroquery has been released in beta as of September 15th, 2013.

Astroquery's first beta release coincided with the .Astronomy 5 conference, at
which a large group of early adopters have tested and contributed to the code
base.  Within 2 days of the release, we added a new module (GAMA_) and added a
new toolkit to SIMBAD
